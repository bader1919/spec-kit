# Feature Specification: N8N Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-wwwnt-you`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i wwwnt you to build a dashboard that get content from my n8n"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Build dashboard that retrieves content from n8n automation platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Dashboard users; Actions: View, monitor; Data: n8n workflows/executions; Constraints: External integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Multiple [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items marked for authentication, data scope, update frequency
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User views n8n workflow status and execution data
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on dashboard functionality and n8n integration
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Identified: Workflow, Execution, Node, Dashboard Widget
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarification needed before planning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarification)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should the dashboard connect to your n8n instance? ‚Üí A: n8n REST API with API key authentication
- Q: How often should the dashboard refresh data from n8n? ‚Üí A: Real-time updates (continuous polling every few seconds)
- Q: Which workflow execution details should the dashboard display? ‚Üí A: Detailed node-level: each step's status, processing time, and errors
- Q: What visual components should the dashboard include? ‚Üí A: Widget-based: cards, charts, status indicators, and graphs
- Q: How many recent executions should the dashboard display? ‚Üí A: Last active 5

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a workflow automation user, I want to view a dashboard that displays information from my n8n instance so that I can monitor workflow status, execution history, and performance metrics without logging into the n8n interface directly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the dashboard is loaded, **When** I view the main screen, **Then** I can see current status of my n8n workflows
2. **Given** workflows are running in n8n, **When** I refresh the dashboard, **Then** I can see updated execution information
3. **Given** a workflow has failed in n8n, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I can see error information and failure details
4. **Given** I want to monitor workflow performance, **When** I access the dashboard, **Then** I can see execution times and success rates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when n8n instance is unavailable or unreachable?
- How does the dashboard handle authentication failures with n8n?
- What occurs when n8n returns incomplete or malformed data?
- How does the system behave when there are no workflows configured in n8n?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve and display workflow information from the user's n8n instance
- **FR-002**: System MUST show current status of workflows (running, stopped, failed, completed)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display the last 5 active executions with timestamps and outcomes
- **FR-004**: System MUST connect to n8n instance via REST API using API key authentication
- **FR-005**: System MUST authenticate with n8n using API key credentials provided by user
- **FR-006**: System MUST refresh dashboard data continuously with polling every few seconds for real-time updates
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle connection errors gracefully and inform users of connectivity issues
- **FR-008**: System MUST display detailed node-level execution information including each step's status, processing time, and error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST present information using widget-based dashboard components including cards, charts, status indicators, and graphs
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to view dashboard without requiring direct n8n interface access

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: Represents an n8n automation workflow with name, status, last execution time, and success/failure state
- **Execution**: Represents a single run of a workflow with start time, end time, status, and execution details
- **Node**: Represents individual steps within a workflow with execution status and processing information
- **Dashboard Widget**: Represents visual components displaying workflow and execution data in various formats
