Phase 3.1: Setup (7/7 completed)
✅ T001: Project structure created (backend/, frontend/, tests directories)
✅ T002: Node.js backend initialized with Express.js, Jest dependencies
✅ T003: React frontend initialized with TypeScript, Chart.js, React Testing Library
✅ T004: ESLint and Prettier configured for backend
✅ T005: ESLint and Prettier configured for frontend
✅ T006: Jest configuration setup for backend
✅ T007: Jest and RTL configuration setup for frontend
Phase 3.2: Tests First - TDD (5/9 completed)
✅ T008-T011: All backend contract tests created (workflows and executions API)
✅ T012: Dashboard load integration test created
⏳ T013-T016: Remaining frontend integration tests (pending)
📂 Files Created
Backend Configuration:
backend/package.json - Dependencies and scripts
backend/.eslintrc.js - Code quality rules
backend/.prettierrc - Code formatting
backend/jest.config.js - Test configuration
Frontend Configuration:
frontend/package.json - Dependencies and scripts
frontend/.eslintrc.js - Code quality rules
frontend/.prettierrc - Code formatting
frontend/jest.config.js - Test configuration
frontend/src/setupTests.ts - Test setup
Test Files (TDD - MUST FAIL FIRST):
backend/tests/contract/workflows-api.test.js - Workflows API contract tests
backend/tests/contract/executions-api.test.js - Executions API contract tests
frontend/tests/integration/dashboard-load.test.js - Dashboard load scenario test
🎯 Constitutional Compliance Status
✅ Specification-First Development: Complete specification exists with clarifications ✅ Test-Driven Development: Tests written before implementation (T008-T012 complete) ✅ Structured Workflow Phases: Following Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Implement ✅ Artifact-Driven Documentation: All design artifacts in place ⏳ TDD Cycle: Tests created and WILL FAIL (no implementation yet) - Ready for implementation phase
📋 Remaining Work (38/50 tasks)
Phase 3.2 Completion: 4 integration tests (T013-T016) Phase 3.3: Backend core - 9 tasks (models, services, routes) Phase 3.4: Frontend core - 10 tasks (React components, hooks, services) Phase 3.5: Integration - 6 tasks (middleware, config, app assembly) Phase 3.6: Polish - 9 tasks (unit tests, performance, documentation)
🚀 Next Steps
Complete Phase 3.2: Create remaining frontend integration tests (T013-T016)
Verify tests fail: Run npm test in both backend and frontend to confirm TDD Red phase
Begin Phase 3.3: Implement backend models (T017-T019) to make tests pass
Continue implementation: Follow task order through Phases 3.4-3.6
Final validation: Ensure all tests pass and features match specification
💡 Key Implementation Notes
Tests are designed to fail: No implementation code exists yet (proper TDD Red-Green-Refactor)
Parallel execution ready: Tasks marked [P] can be implemented concurrently
Contract-driven: API endpoints must match OpenAPI specifications exactly
Real-time polling: Frontend will update every 3-5 seconds via useRealTimeData hook
Error handling: Graceful degradation when n8n instance unavailable
The foundation is now in place to continue implementing the remaining 38 tasks following strict TDD principles!
