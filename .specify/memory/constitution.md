# Spec Kit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Every feature MUST begin with a complete specification before any implementation. Specifications MUST be written in natural language focused on user value and business requirements. No implementation details (technology choices, code structure) are permitted in specifications. Specifications MUST pass clarity validation before proceeding to planning phase.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all implementation work. Tests MUST be written first, MUST fail initially, then implementation follows to make tests pass. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. Contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests follow this ordering without exception.

### III. Constitutional Compliance
All development phases MUST comply with constitutional principles. Constitution checks are performed at key gates: before research, after design, and before implementation. Any constitutional violations MUST be justified in complexity tracking with clear rationale for why simpler alternatives were rejected.

### IV. Structured Workflow Phases
Development MUST follow the six-phase workflow: Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement. Each phase has defined inputs, outputs, and completion criteria. No phase may be skipped without explicit justification. Dependencies between phases MUST be respected.

### V. Artifact-Driven Documentation
Every feature generates structured artifacts in its specs directory: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, and tasks.md. These artifacts MUST maintain consistency and traceability. Cross-artifact analysis validates alignment before implementation begins.

## Quality Gates

Quality gates are enforced at specific checkpoints to ensure constitutional compliance and artifact quality. Gates include specification completeness validation, constitutional compliance verification, cross-artifact consistency analysis, and test-first implementation verification.

## Development Workflow

The framework enforces a branch-based feature development model using numbered branches (###-feature-name). PowerShell scripts automate environment setup, path resolution, and artifact generation. All commands operate through slash command interfaces with JSON-structured script outputs for machine processing.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Constitutional amendments require documentation of the change rationale, impact analysis on existing artifacts, and version increment following semantic versioning rules. All development work MUST verify compliance with current constitutional principles.

Constitutional violations discovered during development MUST be addressed before proceeding to subsequent phases. Complexity justifications are permitted only when simpler constitutional-compliant alternatives have been evaluated and rejected with documented reasoning.

Agent guidance files (CLAUDE.md, etc.) provide runtime development support but cannot override constitutional requirements. These guidance files MUST stay synchronized with constitutional principles through the update-agent-context script.
